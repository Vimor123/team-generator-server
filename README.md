Team Generator Server

## Premise

Have you ever been with a ridiculously large group of friends and decided that the best way to spend the evening (or any part of the day for that matter) is to play casual games in multiple teams, turning your drowsy, boring party into a competative event?

Me neither.

Anyways, in case such a scenario occurs, you will probably find it difficult to divide all your friends into teams. Well, not exactly difficult, but rather a bit time-consuming, 2-5 minutes time-consuming.

But, worry not, because this web app will help you split your friends into groups for the event. And save time. Maybe.

Simply type in the player names so they all appear in the player list, pick the number of teams and click the "Generate Teams" button. The generated teams will be displayed on the right.
